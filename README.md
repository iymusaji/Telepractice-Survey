**Perceptions of Telepractice Stakeholders Among**
An Open Materials Survey
**Version 1.0 â€“ May 2025**

### ðŸ“„ Description
This repository contains the original survey instrument used in the study:

> Roth, B., Musaji, I., & Self, T. (2025). *Telepractice perceptions and needs of Kansas school-based SLPs: A cross-sectional survey study*. Manuscript under review.

The survey was designed to assess school-based speech-language pathologists' (SLPs) perceptions of telepractice, including:
- Consent to participate
- Demographic information
- Perceptions towards telepractice
- Perceived knowledge and skills
- Actual knowledge and skills
- Telepractice-related needs

**Note:**  
This instrument was developed for digital distribution using a platform such as **Qualtrics**. It contains blocks of questions designated for different stakeholder groups. In deployment, **display logic** was used to ensure that each respondent only saw the blocks relevant to their role (e.g., SLPs, administrators).

This survey was created to inform future training and implementation strategies for telepractice in school settings.
